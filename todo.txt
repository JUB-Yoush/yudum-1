grid based dungeon crawler
the gimmick is that you need to push and pull a weapon around 
enemies colliding with your weapon is the only way you can defeat them
goal of each floor is to collect the key and go to the next room.



extra stuff:
you can fire short range projectiles from the weapon (upgrade)


todo:

doing:
- ap timer system
- enemy sword interaction 
- pathfinding (my condolences)
- sword enemy interactions (make some sort of double scan system, player and grabby)
- enemy movement




done:
- fix raycast (have it ignore sword or go past it)
- make enemy
- set up grid based movement
- set up walls
- sword grabbing



enemy behaviour:
enemies go in seek and idle modes
in idle mode, they pick a random direction and just move in it
they have raycasts that shoot out and look for the player
when they find the player, they go into seek mode and pathfind the player untill the player leaves the range

the goal of each level is to find the key and exit through the door tile, which turns into stairs
the key can be found or dropped by defeating an enemy

 player has an ap value, you spend 2 ap moving on your own and 3 ap moving while holding an item 

 few things to fix:
 - multiple items need to prioritize dir held
 - item needs to make checks from itself
 - change moving with item method to just run function from item and return tile


okay my game is wack:
- one ray we pass around like a bong lmao
- things are happening in tandum and multiple actions are taking place at the same time?
- codebase isn't codebased, it's quite codecringe rn

how to fix:
- give every direction a ray, store all the rays and the tiles they check in an array
- try to make check less of a nightmare function
- try to make things happen clearly once after another, use yield liberally
okay branch time
